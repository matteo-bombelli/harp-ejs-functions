# harp-ejs-functions

## IMPORTANT NOTE

This work is in **very early stage**, **pre-alpha**

It doens't work for now (some srippt are not ended).

The reason for putting that online is to "inspire" and search for maybe help on this work.

## Indications 

All this features are made to be used with [harpjs](http://harpjs.com/) on top of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[here](http://harpjs.com/docs/quick-start) you can see also the install guide for harpjs

A list of functions to create a website in harp with more features using ejs templating engine.

## Goals

Use harp features and build functions to make editing and websites creation easier and faster and more advanced features (widgets...)

## Note on templating

Jade scares me cause it is harder for me to divide markups, content & script, so i use ejs

## Note on .bat files... 

I use Windows so I've included some easy bat files to speed up harp execution

## For you

Please Fork and develop with me

And have fun while coding!
