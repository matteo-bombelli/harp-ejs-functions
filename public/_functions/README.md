# Functions

Here is the core of this project.

`MB` is the global object that contains all the functions that can be used in the project

`MB` has different proprerties that rapresents subsections/categories of functions

for example 

* `MB.posts` contains the functions about posts and blog

* `MB.files` contains the functions about filesystem

* `MB.locale` contains the functions about translations and languages

and many more...

the `functions.ejs` file is well documented (I hope)
